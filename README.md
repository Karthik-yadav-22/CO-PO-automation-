# CO-PO-automation

An end-to-end automation framework for Outcome-Based Education (OBE) that calculates Course Outcome (CO) attainment, performs CO–PO mapping using NLP, and intelligently maps exam questions to COs using Bloom’s Taxonomy.

  This project was done under the guidance of my professor Mr. M.A Hameed sir 
which is now being used in the University College of Engineering, Osmania University's admistration of all 8 branches

# 📌 Problem Statement

Manual calculation of CO attainment and CO–PO mapping is:

->Time-consuming

->Error-prone

->Difficult to scale for large datasets

This project automates the entire workflow, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and NBA compliance.

# 🚀 Features
-> Automatic CO Attainment from Excel marksheets

-> AI-based CO–PO mapping using semantic similarity

-> Question-to-CO mapping using NLP (Bloom’s Taxonomy aligned)

-> Simple GUI for administrative use

-> Results generated in seconds

# 🧩 Project Modules

1️⃣ CO Attainment Calculator

        Calculates Course Outcome attainment directly from student marks.
        using popular data analytics frameworks like NumPy and Pandas
        
2️⃣ CO–PO Mapping (NLP-Based)

        Maps Course Outcomes to Program Outcomes using semantic similarity.
        using Hugging Face's SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), Cosine similarity for word embeddings

3️⃣ Question-to-CO Mapping using Bloom’s Taxonomy

        This module automatically maps exam questions to the most relevant CO using NLP.
